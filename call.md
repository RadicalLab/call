<h2>Call for participation at the inaugural conference of the Radical Humanities Laboratory</h2>
<h2>University College Cork</h2>
<h3>8 - 9 May 2024
Submission deadline: <b>12 December 2023 </b> </h3>


What potential do the humanities hold today – and how might research and praxis animate these visions? Ours is an epoch of violence and apparent breakdown, with long-term sources. But it is also an era of unexpected conjunctures and new possibilities. The foundations of contemporary politics, economics and society reconfigure around us as inherited visions of the future are transformed and revaluated. Technological change and transformations disorient all stable reference points.  

We ask: “What forms of thought and practice can meet such a moment?” 

To be radical means to grasp things by the root. In practice, to be radical requires an aspiration towards a better future coupled with a commitment to act towards it. The Radical Humanities Laboratory at University College Cork is a space for post- and anti- disciplinary practice. It places critical and experimental work from the humanities at the heart of fundamental research.  

The Radical Humanities Laboratory: Radical Futures invites scholars, scientists, artists, activists, archivists, and policy shapers, to engage in conversations about the roots of present crises – ecological, political and social, and how collective futures might be better understood, transformed and lived differently as new potentials and trajectories emerge.
